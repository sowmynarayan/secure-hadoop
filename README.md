===========

The rising abuse of information stored on large data centers in cloud emphasizes
the need to safeguard data. Despite adopting strict authentication policies for
cloud users and transferring data over SSL/TLS when data reaches data center
it is vulnerable to numerous attacks. Protecting stored data effectively involves
embedding hardware wherein encryption is performed on disk. The other in-
teresting and most widely adaptable methodology is safeguarding at software
level. Encrypting data at rest prevents unauthorized access of confidential in-
formation. Encryption of large data which is a time consuming process needs
to be controlled by an efficient application of the process in parallel mode. The
aim of this project is to propose a method to perform encryption in parallel
using standard XTS-AES approach. The proposed methodology gives efficient
results when compression is performed before encryption.The experimental re-
sults generated gives compression ratio in the order of 1:10 which proves that the
concept suits well for a cloud computing data-storage environment.The above
concept implemented using MapReduce framework shows that vendor specific
cloud computing model can make use of such concept for securing their data
store.
